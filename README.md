# Cardinal Engine
Cardinal Engine is an experimental game engine programmed for a project at 
the <a href="http://www.enjmin.fr/">Enjmin</a>, the national school of video games. 
The main goal of the project was to learn about rendering and procedural generation 
in video games. Cardinal Engine is fully written in C++ with OpenGL 3 and use some third party 
libraries :
* Glew
* Glfw 
* Glm
* OpenAL
* Bullet3
* ImGui
* Google Test

The project is under CMake 3.2 and is compatible (tested) with Microsoft
Visual Studio 2017 (CMake support), CLion (tested) and more. The engine is currently 
compiling on Windows and has a theoretical compatibility with Linux and Mac if right
flags are passed to CMake because the project contains only sources.
